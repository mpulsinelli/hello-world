# hello-world
Just another repository 
My name is Mike Pulsinelli and i'm 29 years old (in 2018). I work for a regional insurance brokerage underwriting group health plans. I'm learning to code so that I can automate some tedious, repetitive processes and hopefully save myself some time and energy.
